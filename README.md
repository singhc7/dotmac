# Dotfiles

A minimalist, personal collection of configuration files optimized for a resource-efficient workflow on macOS.

## Overview
This repository manages my core terminal environment and tooling configurations. It relies on [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to handle symlinking these configuration files directly into the home directory, keeping the system clean and the dotfiles easily version-controlled.

**Primary terminal:** Kitty (Adwaita darker theme) | **Prompt:** Powerlevel10k | **Editor:** Neovim

> The `alacritty/` directory is kept as an archived configuration. Kitty is the actively maintained terminal emulator.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying, ensure the following are installed on your system:
* `git`
* `stow`

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository** into your home directory:

        git clone https://github.com/singhc7/dotmac.git ~/.dotfiles
        cd ~/.dotfiles

2. **Run the bootstrap script** to install all dependencies and deploy configs:

        ./forge

   Use `forge --dry-run` to preview what would be installed without making changes.

### Manual Deployment

Deploy individual configurations using Stow:

        stow zsh
        stow kitty

*Note: Stow will automatically create symlinks from the folders in this repository to their appropriate locations in your home directory.*

I believe in sharing knowledge and highly optimized workflows, but I also strictly protect my property rights. Here is exactly what that means for you:

* **For Individuals (Free):** You are fully encouraged to clone, modify, and run these dotfiles for your personal study, hobby projects, private entertainment, and amateur pursuits. Use by educational institutions and charitable organizations is also completely free and permitted.
* **For Commercial Entities (Restricted):** You may **not** incorporate these configurations into any paid product, commercial service, or internal corporate environment.

The baseline is simple: if a price tag gets attached to my work, I am the one who gets paid. If you wish to use this setup for commercial purposes, you must contact me directly to negotiate a separate, paid commercial license.
